3D primitives, boolean operations, transforms, patterns, imports, and parameters.

## Functions

### 3D Primitives

Create basic 3D shapes.

#### `box()`

```ts
box$1(x: number, y: number, z: number, center?: boolean): TrackedShape
```

Create a rectangular box with named faces and edges. When center is false (default), one corner sits at the origin. Returns a TrackedShape with faces (top, bottom, side-left, side-right, side-top, side-bottom) and edges (vert-bl, vert-br, vert-tr, vert-tl, etc.).

#### `cylinder()`

```ts
cylinder$1(height: number, radius: number, radiusTop?: number, segments?: number, center?: boolean): TrackedShape
```

Create a cylinder or cone with named faces and edges. When radiusTop differs from radius, creates a tapered cone. Use segments for regular prisms. Returns a TrackedShape with faces (top, bottom, side) and edges (top-rim, bottom-rim).

#### `sphere()`

```ts
sphere$1(radius: number, segments?: number): Shape
```

Create a sphere centered at the origin. Use segments for lower-poly approximations. @concept primitive

### Boolean Operations

Combine shapes using set operations.

#### `union()`

```ts
union(...shapes: (_ShapeOperand | _ShapeOperand[])[]): Shape
```

Combine shapes into a single solid (additive boolean). Accepts individual shapes or arrays. @concept boolean

#### `difference()`

```ts
difference(...shapes: (_ShapeOperand | _ShapeOperand[])[]): Shape
```

Subtract shapes from a base shape. The first shape is the base; all subsequent shapes are subtracted. @concept boolean

#### `intersection()`

```ts
intersection(...shapes: (_ShapeOperand | _ShapeOperand[])[]): Shape
```

Keep only the overlapping volume of the input shapes (intersection boolean). @concept boolean

### Patterns & Topology

Repeat, mirror, fillet, and chamfer geometry.

#### `filletEdgeSegment()`

```ts
filletEdgeSegment(shape: ShapeArg, segment: EdgeSegment, radius: number, segments?: number): Shape
```

```

</details>

#### `chamferEdgeSegment()`

```ts
chamferEdgeSegment(shape: ShapeArg, segment: EdgeSegment, size: number): Shape
```

#### `selectEdges()`

```ts
selectEdges(shape: Shape | TrackedShape, query?: EdgeQuery): EdgeSegment[]
```

Select all edges from a shape that match the given query. Extracts sharp edges from the mesh (dihedral angle > 1°), applies filters, and returns the matching EdgeSegment array.

#### `coalesceEdges()`

```ts
coalesceEdges(segments: EdgeSegment[], tolerance?: number): EdgeSegment[]
```

Coalesce collinear edge segments into longer logical edges. Multiple short mesh segments along the same line (e.g. from tessellation) are merged into a single EdgeSegment spanning the full extent. The `tolerance` controls how far endpoints can deviate from collinearity.

#### `arcBridgeBetweenRects()`

```ts
arcBridgeBetweenRects(rectA: RectAreaArg, rectB: RectAreaArg, segments?: number): Shape
```

Build an arc bridge between two rectangular areas.

#### `filletEdge()`

```ts
filletEdge(shape: ShapeArg$2, edge: EdgeRef, radius: number, quadrant?: [ number, number ], segments?: number): Shape
```

Round a named edge of a shape with a circular fillet of the given radius. Requires a compile-covered target.

circularPattern(shape: ShapeArg$3, count: number, centerXOrOpts?: number | CircularPatternOptions, centerY?: number): Shape
```

Repeat a shape in a circular pattern around an axis and union the copies. Simple usage (Z axis, matches legacy signature): circularPattern(shape, 6) circularPattern(shape, 6, 10, 20)           // centerX=10, centerY=20 Advanced usage (arbitrary axis): circularPattern(shape, 6, { axis: [1, 0, 0], origin: [0, 0, 50] })

```ts
boolParam(name: string, defaultValue: boolean): boolean
```

Declare a boolean parameter. Returns the current boolean value. Renders as a checkbox in the UI.

### Grouping

Organize multiple shapes into named groups.

#### `group()`

```ts
group(...items: GroupInput[]): ShapeGroup
```

Group multiple shapes/sketches for joint transforms without merging into a single mesh. Unlike union(), colors and individual identities are preserved. Children can be plain shapes, named descriptors ({ name, shape/sketch/group }), or nested groups. The returned ShapeGroup supports all Shape transforms (translate, rotate, etc.).

### Section & Projection

intersectWithPlane(shape: Shape, plane: PlaneSpec): Sketch
```

Cross-section: slice a 3D shape with a plane and return the intersection as a 2D Sketch.

#### `projectToPlane()`

```ts
projectToPlane(shape: Shape, plane: PlaneSpec): Sketch
```

Orthographically project a 3D shape onto a plane and return the silhouette as a 2D Sketch.

### Other

#### `composeChain()`

```ts
composeChain(...steps: TransformInput[]): Transform
```

Compose transforms in chain order. Equivalent to Transform.identity().mul(a).mul(b).mul(c)...

#### `portFactory()`

```ts
portFactory(input: PortInput): PortDef
```

<details><summary><code>PortInput</code></summary>

```ts
interface PortInput {
  kind?: JointType;
  min?: number;
  max?: number;
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><code>PortDef</code></summary>

```ts
interface PortDef {
  origin: Vec3;
  axis: Vec3;
  up: Vec3;
  extent?: number;
  kind?: JointType;
  min?: number;
  max?: number;
}
```

</details>

#### `polar()`

```ts
polar(length: number, angleDeg: number, from?: [ number, number ]): [ number, number ]
```

Compute a point by moving a given distance at a given angle from a start point. Angle is in degrees, measured CCW from the +X axis (standard math convention). Returns `[x, y]`. ```js polar(10, 45)            // [7.07, 7.07] — from origin polar(10, 45, [5, 5])    // [12.07, 12.07] — from (5,5) ```

#### `fillet()`

```ts
fillet(shape: ShapeArg$1, radius: number, edges?: EdgeSelector, segments?: number): Shape
```

Apply fillets (rounded edges) to one or more edges of a shape. Works on both straight and curved edges. Supports OCCT and Manifold backends. When using OCCT, all edges are filleted in a single kernel operation for best quality. When using Manifold, edges are filleted sequentially. - EdgeSegment: a single edge from selectEdge() - EdgeSegment[]: multiple edges from selectEdges() - EdgeQuery: inline query (same options as selectEdges) - undefined: all sharp edges on the shape // Fillet all edges fillet(myShape, 2) // Fillet edges at the top fillet(myShape, 1.5, { atZ: 20, convex: true }) // Fillet specific edges const edges = selectEdges(myShape, { parallel: [0, 0, 1] }) fillet(myShape, 3, edges)

#### `chamfer()`

```ts
chamfer(shape: ShapeArg$1, size: number, edges?: EdgeSelector): Shape
```

Apply chamfers (beveled edges) to one or more edges of a shape. Works on both straight and curved edges. Supports OCCT and Manifold backends. // Chamfer all edges chamfer(myShape, 1) // Chamfer vertical edges only chamfer(myShape, 2, { parallel: [0, 0, 1] })

#### `draft()`

```ts
draft(shape: ShapeArg$1, angleDeg: number, pullDirection?: [ number, number, number ], neutralPlaneOffset?: number): Shape
```

Apply a draft angle (taper) to all faces of a solid for mold extraction. Draft angle is a manufacturing feature that adds taper to the vertical faces of a solid so that it can be extracted from a mold. The neutral plane is where the draft angle is zero — faces above and below are tapered symmetrically. Requires the OCCT backend. Throws on Manifold. // Add 3° draft to a box for injection molding draft(myBox, 3) // Draft with custom pull direction and neutral plane draft(myShape, 2, [0, 0, 1], 10)

#### `offsetSolid()`

```ts
offsetSolid(shape: ShapeArg$1, thickness: number): Shape
```

Uniformly offset all surfaces of a solid inward or outward by a thickness value. Unlike shell(), which hollows a solid, offsetSolid() produces a new solid whose surfaces are all shifted by the given thickness. Positive = outward, negative = inward. Requires the OCCT backend. Throws on Manifold. // Grow a box outward by 1mm on all sides offsetSolid(myBox, 1) // Shrink a shape inward by 0.5mm offsetSolid(myShape, -0.5)

#### `loftAlongSpine()`

```ts
loftAlongSpine(profiles: Sketch[], spine: Curve3D | Vec3$3[], tValues: number[], options?: LoftAlongSpineOptions): Shape
```

Loft between multiple profiles positioned along an arbitrary 3D spine curve. Unlike loft() which only supports Z heights, loftAlongSpine() places each profile at a position along a 3D spine, oriented perpendicular to the spine tangent. This enables lofting along curved paths — e.g., a wing root-to-tip transition that follows a swept-back leading edge. The tValues array specifies where each profile sits along the spine (0 = start, 1 = end). Must have the same length as profiles and be in [0, 1]. Internally uses variableSweep infrastructure with SDF interpolation. Performance note: uses level-set meshing, heavier than simple loft().

<details><summary><code>LoftAlongSpineOptions</code></summary>

```ts
interface LoftAlongSpineOptions {
  /** Number of samples when spine is a Curve3D. Default 48. */
  samples?: number;
  /** Marching-grid edge length for level-set meshing. Smaller = finer. */
  edgeLength?: number;
  /** Optional extra bounds padding. */
  boundsPadding?: number;
  /** Preferred "up" vector for local profile frame. Auto fallback is used near parallel segments. */
  up?: Vec3$3;
}
```

</details>

#### `variableSweep()`

```ts
variableSweep(spine: Curve3D | Vec3$3[], sections: VariableSweepSection[], options?: VariableSweepOptions): Shape
```

Sweep a variable cross-section along a 3D spine curve. Unlike sweep(), which uses a single constant profile, variableSweep() interpolates between multiple profiles at different stations along the spine. This enables organic shapes like tapering tubes, bone-like structures, and sculptural forms. Each section specifies a t parameter (0 = start, 1 = end of spine) and a 2D profile sketch. The SDF-based level-set mesher smoothly blends between profiles at intermediate positions. Performance note: like sweep(), this uses level-set meshing internally.

<details><summary><code>VariableSweepSection</code></summary>

```ts
interface VariableSweepSection {
  /** Parameter along the spine (0 = start, 1 = end). */
  t: number;
  /** Cross-section profile at this station. */
  profile: Sketch;
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><code>VariableSweepOptions</code></summary>

```ts
interface VariableSweepOptions {
  /** Number of samples when spine is a Curve3D. Default 48. */
  samples?: number;
  /** Marching-grid edge length for level-set meshing. Smaller = finer. */
  edgeLength?: number;
  /** Optional extra bounds padding. */
  boundsPadding?: number;
  /** Preferred "up" vector for local profile frame. Auto fallback is used near parallel segments. */
  up?: Vec3$3;
}
```

</details>

#### `loadFont()`

```ts
loadFont(source: string | ArrayBuffer, cacheKey?: string): opentype$1.Font
```

Load and cache a font. - A built-in font name: `'sans-serif'` or `'inter'` (works everywhere) - A file path to a TTF/OTF/WOFF file (CLI/Node only) - An ArrayBuffer of font data (works everywhere)

#### `hermiteTransition()`

```ts
hermiteTransition(a: EdgeEndpoint, b: EdgeEndpoint): HermiteCurve3D
```

Create a Hermite transition curve between two edge endpoints. The curve starts at `a.point` tangent to `a.tangent` and ends at `b.point` tangent to `b.tangent`, with smooth G1-continuous interpolation. Weight controls: - weight = 1.0 (default): balanced transition - weight > 1.0: curve follows this edge's direction longer before turning - weight < 1.0: curve turns sooner, shorter tangent influence

<details><summary><code>EdgeEndpoint</code></summary>

```ts
interface EdgeEndpoint {
  /** Connection point on the edge */
  point: Vec3$4;
  /** Tangent direction along the edge at the connection point */
  tangent: Vec3$4;
  /** Surface normal at the connection point (optional, for future G2 support) */
  normal?: Vec3$4;
  /** Weight controlling how far the curve follows this edge's tangent. Default 1.0. */
  weight?: number;
}
```

</details>

#### `hermiteTransitionG2()`

```ts
hermiteTransitionG2(a: QuinticHermiteCurveEndpoint, b: QuinticHermiteCurveEndpoint): QuinticHermiteCurve3D
```

Create a quintic Hermite transition curve between two edge endpoints (G2 continuity). The curve starts at `a.point` tangent to `a.tangent` with curvature `a.curvature`, and ends at `b.point` tangent to `b.tangent` with curvature `b.curvature`, with smooth G2-continuous interpolation matching position, tangent, and curvature.

<details><summary><code>QuinticHermiteCurveEndpoint</code></summary>

```ts
interface QuinticHermiteCurveEndpoint {
  /** Position */
  point: Vec3$4;
  /** Tangent direction (will be normalized internally) */
  tangent: Vec3$4;
  /** Second derivative / curvature vector. Default [0, 0, 0]. */
  curvature?: Vec3$4;
  /** Weight: scales tangent magnitude relative to chord length. Default 1.0. */
  weight?: number;
}
```

</details>

#### `circularLayout()`

```ts
circularLayout(count: number, radius: number, options?: CircularLayoutOptions): LayoutPoint[]
```

Compute evenly-spaced positions around a circle. Eliminates the most common trig pattern in CAD scripts: ```js // Before — manual trig for (let i = 0; i < 12; i++) { const angle = i * 30 * Math.PI / 180; markers.push(marker.translate(r * Math.cos(angle), r * Math.sin(angle), 0)); } // After — declarative for (const {x, y} of circularLayout(12, r)) { markers.push(marker.translate(x, y, 0)); } ```

<details><summary><code>CircularLayoutOptions</code></summary>

```ts
interface CircularLayoutOptions {
  /** Angle of the first element in degrees (default: 0 = +X axis). */
  startDeg?: number;
  /** Center X coordinate (default: 0). */
  centerX?: number;
  /** Center Y coordinate (default: 0). */
  centerY?: number;
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><code>LayoutPoint</code></summary>

interface LayoutPoint {
  x: number;
  y: number;
}
```

</details>

#### `polygonVertices()`

```ts
polygonVertices(sides: number, radius: number, options?: PolygonVerticesOptions): LayoutPoint[]
```

Compute the vertex positions of a regular polygon. Default orientation places the first vertex at the top (90 degrees), matching the convention used by `ngon()`. Eliminates manual Math.sqrt(3) for triangles, pentagon vertex math, etc: ```js // Before — manual equilateral triangle const v1 = [center.x - r/2, center.y + r * Math.sqrt(3)/2]; const v2 = [center.x - r/2, center.y - r * Math.sqrt(3)/2]; const v3 = [center.x + r, center.y]; // After — declarative const [v1, v2, v3] = polygonVertices(3, r); ```

<details><summary><code>PolygonVerticesOptions</code></summary>

```ts
interface PolygonVerticesOptions {
  /** Angle of the first vertex in degrees (default: 90 = top). */
  startDeg?: number;
  /** Center X coordinate (default: 0). */
  centerX?: number;
  /** Center Y coordinate (default: 0). */
  centerY?: number;
}
```

</details>

#### `routePerimeter()`

```ts
routePerimeter(steps: PerimeterStep[]): Sketch
```

Route a smooth closed perimeter around a sequence of construction circles, connected by tangent fillet arcs. Steps must alternate: circle, fillet, circle, fillet, ... The sequence wraps — the last fillet connects back to the first circle. ```js const outline = routePerimeter([ { center: [0, 0], radius: 45 }, { fillet: 5 }, { center: polar(60, 60), radius: 18 }, { fillet: 17 }, { center: polar(60, 120), radius: 18 }, { fillet: 5 }, ]) ```

```

Repeat a sketch in a circular pattern around a center point

#### `arcSlot()`

```ts
arcSlot(pitchRadius: number, sweepDeg: number, thickness: number): Sketch
```

Create an arc-shaped slot (banana/annular sector) centered at the origin. The slot is symmetric about the +X axis. ```js arcSlot(135, 74, 40)  // pitch R135, 74° sweep, 40mm wide ```

#### `surfacePatch()`

```ts
surfacePatch(curves: { ... }, options?: SurfacePatchOptions): Shape
```

Create a smooth surface patch from 4 boundary curves (Coons patch). The four curves form the boundary of a quadrilateral patch: - bottom: u=0..1 at v=0 (from corner00 to corner10) - top: u=0..1 at v=1 (from corner01 to corner11) - left: v=0..1 at u=0 (from corner00 to corner01) - right: v=0..1 at u=1 (from corner10 to corner11) The interior is filled using bilinear Coons patch interpolation: P(u,v) = Lc(u,v) + Ld(u,v) - B(u,v) The result is a thin solid created by offsetting the surface mesh along its normals by the specified thickness. Note: curves should meet at corners. Small gaps are tolerated.

<details><summary><code>SurfacePatchOptions</code></summary>

```ts
interface SurfacePatchOptions {
  /** Number of samples along each direction. Default 24. */
  resolution?: number;
  /** Thickness of the generated solid. Default 0.5. */
  thickness?: number;
}
```

</details>

#### `transitionCurve()`

```ts
transitionCurve(edgeA: TransitionEdge, edgeB: TransitionEdge, options?: TransitionCurveOptions): HermiteCurve3D
```

Create a smooth transition curve between two edges. Returns a `HermiteCurve3D` that starts at `edgeA.point` tangent to `edgeA.tangent` and ends at `edgeB.point` tangent to `edgeB.tangent`. The curve maintains G1 continuity (matching tangent direction) at both endpoints. Weight parameters control the shape of the transition. ```js // Connect two edges with a balanced transition const curve = transitionCurve( { point: [0, 0, 0], tangent: [1, 0, 0] }, { point: [10, 5, 0], tangent: [1, 0, 0] }, ); // Weighted: curve hugs edge A longer const weighted = transitionCurve( { point: [0, 0, 0], tangent: [1, 0, 0] }, { point: [10, 5, 0], tangent: [1, 0, 0] }, { weightA: 2.0, weightB: 0.5 }, ); ```

<details><summary><code>TransitionEdge</code></summary>

```ts
interface TransitionEdge {
  /** Connection point on the edge. Can be any point along the edge where the transition should connect. */
  point: Vec3$6;
  /** Tangent direction at the connection point. This is the direction the curve should initially follow when leaving this edge. For a straight edge, this is typically the edge direction pointing "outward" (away from the body of the edge, toward the other edge). */
  tangent: Vec3$6;
  /** Surface normal at the connection point (optional). Used as a hint for the sweep frame's up vector. */
  normal?: Vec3$6;
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><code>TransitionCurveOptions</code></summary>

```ts
interface TransitionCurveOptions {
  /** Weight for the start edge. Controls tangent magnitude at the start. - 1.0 (default): balanced transition - > 1.0: curve follows start edge longer before turning - < 1.0: curve turns sooner at the start */
  weightA?: number;
  /** Weight for the end edge. Controls tangent magnitude at the end. - 1.0 (default): balanced transition - > 1.0: curve follows end edge longer before turning - < 1.0: curve turns sooner at the end */
  weightB?: number;
  /** Number of sample points for the output polyline. Default 64. Higher values give smoother curves at the cost of more geometry. */
  samples?: number;
}
```

</details>

#### `transitionSurface()`

```ts
transitionSurface(edgeA: TransitionEdge, edgeB: TransitionEdge, options?: TransitionSurfaceOptions): Shape
```

Create a solid transition surface between two edges by sweeping a profile along a Hermite transition curve. This produces a watertight solid that smoothly connects the two edges. Works with both Manifold and OCCT backends. ```js // Circular tube connecting two edges const tube = transitionSurface( { point: [0, 0, 0], tangent: [1, 0, 0] }, { point: [10, 5, 3], tangent: [0, 1, 0] }, { radius: 0.5 }, ); // Custom profile with weights const custom = transitionSurface( { point: [0, 0, 0], tangent: [1, 0, 0] }, { point: [10, 5, 3], tangent: [0, 1, 0] }, { profile: mySketch, weightA: 1.5, weightB: 0.8 }, ); ```


<details><summary><code>TransitionSurfaceOptions</code> extends TransitionCurveOptions</summary>

```ts
interface TransitionSurfaceOptions extends TransitionCurveOptions {
  /** Cross-section profile to sweep along the transition curve. If omitted, a circular profile with `radius` is used. */
  profile?: Sketch;
  /** Radius of circular cross-section (used when `profile` is omitted). Default: 5% of chord length. */
  radius?: number;
  width: number;
  height: number;
  /** Preferred up vector for the sweep frame. Default: auto-detected. */

}
```

</details>

#### `transitionCurveFromPoints()`

```ts
transitionCurveFromPoints(startPoint: Vec3$6, startTangent: Vec3$6, endPoint: Vec3$6, endTangent: Vec3$6, options?: TransitionCurveOptions): HermiteCurve3D
```

Convenience: create a transition curve from raw coordinate data. Useful when you have endpoints and directions as plain arrays without constructing TransitionEdge objects.

#### `pickEdge()`

```ts
pickEdge(edge: EdgeRef, options?: EdgePickOptions): TransitionEdge
```

Pick a connection point from an EdgeRef (tracked topology edge). EdgeRef has `start` and `end` positions. The tangent is inferred from the edge direction. ```js const box1 = rect(10, 10).extrude(10); const topEdge = box1.edge('top-front'); // Connect from the start of the top-front edge, tangent along the edge const edgeA = pickEdge(topEdge, { end: 'start' }); // Connect from the end, with flipped tangent const edgeB = pickEdge(topEdge, { end: 'end', flip: true }); ```

<details><summary><code>EdgeRef</code></summary>

```ts
interface EdgeRef {
  name: EdgeName;
  /** Compiler-owned edge query when available. */
  query?: EdgeQueryRef;
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><code>EdgePickOptions</code></summary>

```ts
interface EdgePickOptions {
  /** Which end of the edge to connect. Default: 'start'. */
  end?: EdgeEnd;
  /** How to determine the tangent direction. Default: 'along'. - 'along': tangent follows the edge direction - 'outward': tangent points along surface normal (requires EdgeSegment) - 'auto': automatically computed (toward the other edge) */
  tangentMode?: TangentMode;
  /** Explicit tangent override (ignores tangentMode). */
  tangent?: Vec3$6;
  /** Flip the computed tangent direction (useful for 'along' mode). */
  flip?: boolean;
}
```

</details>

#### `pickEdgeSegment()`

```ts
pickEdgeSegment(edge: EdgeSegment, options?: EdgePickOptions): TransitionEdge
```

Pick a connection point from an EdgeSegment (from selectEdge/selectEdges). EdgeSegment has richer data including surface normals on both sides, enabling 'outward' tangent mode for transitions that leave the surface. ```js const myBox = box(20, 20, 20); const topEdge = selectEdge(myBox, { atZ: 20, parallel: [1, 0, 0] }); // Connect from edge start, tangent along the edge direction const edgeA = pickEdgeSegment(topEdge, { end: 'start' }); // Connect from midpoint, tangent pointing outward (away from surface) const edgeB = pickEdgeSegment(topEdge, { end: 'mid', tangentMode: 'outward' }); ```

  /** Flip tangent A. */
  flipA?: boolean;
  /** Flip tangent B. */
  flipB?: boolean;
}
```

</details>

#### `spec()`

```ts
spec(name: string, checkFn: (...args: any[]) => void): Spec
```

Create a named spec — a reusable bundle of verification checks. ```js const fitSpec = spec("Fits enclosure", (shape) => { verify.lessThan("Width",  shape.boundingBox().max[0] - shape.boundingBox().min[0], 200); verify.notEmpty("Has geometry", shape); }); fitSpec.check(myShape);   // grouped as "Fits enclosure" in the Checks panel fitSpec.check(otherShape); // can be reused on multiple shapes ``` calls `verify.*` methods.

## Classes

### `Shape`

Core 3D solid shape. All operations are immutable and return new shapes. Supports transforms (translate, rotate, scale, mirror, transform, rotateAround, pointAlong), booleans (add, subtract, intersect), cutting (split, splitByPlane, trimByPlane), shelling, anchor positioning (attachTo, onFace), placement references, and queries (volume, surfaceArea, boundingBox, isEmpty, numTri, geometryInfo).

**Properties:**

| Property | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `materialProps` | `ShapeMaterialProps | undefined` | — |

**Methods:**

- `setColor()` — Set the color of this shape (hex string, e.g. "#ff0000")
- `color()` — Alias for setColor
- `material()` — Set material properties for this shape's visual appearance. Returns a new Shape with the specified material properties merged. ```js box(50, 50, 50).material({ metalness: 0.9, roughness: 0.1 }); sphere(30).material({ emissive: '#ff6b35', emissiveIntensity: 2 }); cylinder(40, 20).material({ opacity: 0.3 }); ```
- `clone()` — Return a new Shape wrapper for explicit duplication in scripts.
- `duplicate()` — Alias for clone()
- `geometryInfo()` — Inspect which backend/representation produced this solid.
- `withReferences()` — Attach named placement references that survive normal transforms and imports.
- `referenceNames()` — List named placement references carried by this shape.
- `withPorts()` — Attach named assembly ports (origin + axis + up) that survive transforms and imports.
- `portNames()` — List named port identifiers carried by this shape.
- `referencePoint()` — Resolve a named placement reference or built-in anchor to a 3D point.
- `face()` — Resolve a semantic face by name or query.  Works on compile-covered shapes and, as a fallback, on any planar-faced mesh (e.g. the result of boolean ops) via coplanar triangle clustering.
- `faces()` — Return all faces matching a query, or all mesh-detected faces when no query is given.
- `faceNames()` — List defended semantic face names currently available on this shape.
- `faceHistory()` — Get the transformation history for a specific face.
- `placeReference()` — Translate the shape so the given reference lands on the target coordinate.
- `translatePolar()` — Translate using polar coordinates (radius + angle in degrees). Eliminates manual `r * Math.cos(angle * PI/180)` calculations. Example: `shape.translatePolar(50, 30)` moves 50mm at 30 degrees from +X.
- `translate()` — Move the shape relative to its current position. All transforms are immutable and return new shapes.
- `moveTo()` — Position the shape so its bounding box min corner is at the given global coordinate.
- `moveToLocal()` — Position the shape relative to another shape's local coordinate system (bounding box min corner).
- `rotate()` — Rotate the shape. Two call forms are supported: - Axis form (preferred): `rotate(axis, angleDeg, { pivot? })` — rotate around an arbitrary axis through the origin (or an optional pivot). - Legacy Euler form: `rotate(xDeg, yDeg, zDeg)` — rotate by Euler angles around each axis. The form is selected by the first argument: an array is treated as an axis, three numbers as Euler angles.
- `rotateX()` — Rotate around the X axis by the given angle in degrees (optionally through a pivot point).
- `rotateY()` — Rotate around the Y axis by the given angle in degrees (optionally through a pivot point).
- `rotateZ()` — Rotate around the Z axis by the given angle in degrees (optionally through a pivot point).
- `transform()` — Apply a 4x4 affine transform matrix (column-major) or a Transform object.
- `scale()` — Scale the shape uniformly or per-axis from the shape's bounding box center. Accepts a single number or [x, y, z] array.
- `scaleAround()` — Scale the shape uniformly or per-axis from an explicit pivot point.
- `mirror()` — Mirror across a plane through the shape's bounding box center, defined by its normal vector (need not be unit length).
- `mirrorThrough()` — Mirror across a plane through an explicit point, defined by its normal vector (need not be unit length).
- `pointAlong()` — Reorient a shape so its primary axis (Z) points along the given direction. Useful for laying cylinders/extrusions along X or Y without thinking about Euler angles. Example: cylinder(40, 5).pointAlong([1, 0, 0]) — lays cylinder along X
- `rotateAround()` — Rotate around an arbitrary axis through a pivot point. Equivalent to: translate(-pivot) → rotate around axis → translate(+pivot)
- `rotateAroundTo()` — Rotate around an axis until a moving point reaches the target line/plane defined by the axis and target point. `movingPoint` / `targetPoint` may be raw world points or this shape's anchors/references.
- `add()` — Union this shape with others (additive boolean). Method form of union().
- `subtract()` — Subtract other shapes from this one. Method form of difference().
- `intersect()` — Keep only the overlap with other shapes. Method form of intersection().
- `split()` — Split into [inside, outside] by another shape.
- `splitByPlane()` — Split by infinite plane. Returns [positive-side, negative-side].
- `trimByPlane()` — Keep the positive side of the plane and discard the opposite side.
- `shell()` — Hollow out compile-covered boxes, cylinders, and straight extrudes. `openFaces` names any subset of the base shape's faces to leave open (no wall). Box bases accept any of: top, bottom, front (=side-bottom), back (=side-top), left (=side-left), right (=side-right), or the raw internal names. Cylinder and extrude bases accept top and bottom only.
- `boundingBox()` — Get the axis-aligned bounding box as { min: [x,y,z], max: [x,y,z] }.
- `volume()` — Volume in mm cubed.
- `surfaceArea()` — Surface area in mm squared.

- `numBodies()` — Number of disconnected solid bodies in this shape.
- `numTri()` — Triangle count of the mesh representation.
- `getMesh()` — Extract triangle mesh for Three.js rendering
- `slice()` — Slice the runtime solid by a plane normal to local Z at the given offset.
- `project()` — Orthographically project the runtime solid onto the local XY plane.
- `attachTo()` — Position this shape relative to another using named 3D anchor points. Anchors are bounding-box-relative: 'center', face centers ('top', 'front', ...), edge midpoints ('top-front', 'back-left', ...), and corners ('top-front-left', ...). Anchor word order is flexible: 'front-left' and 'left-front' are equivalent. Named placement references (from withReferences) can also be used as anchors.
- `onFace()` — Place this shape on a face of a parent shape. Think of it like sticking a label on a box surface: - `face` picks which surface ('front', 'back', 'top', etc.) - `u, v` position within that face's 2D plane (from center) - front/back: u = left/right (X), v = up/down (Z) - left/right: u = forward/back (Y), v = up/down (Z) - top/bottom: u = left/right (X), v = forward/back (Y) - `protrude` = how far the child sticks out (positive = outward from face)
- `pocket()` — Cut a pocket (cavity) into this solid through the named face. box(100, 100, 20).pocket('top', 8) box(100, 100, 20).pocket('top', 8, { inset: 5 }) box(100, 100, 20).pocket('top', 8, { scale: 0.8 })
- `boss()` — Add a boss (protrusion) from the named face. box(100, 100, 20).boss('top', 5) box(100, 100, 20).boss('top', 10, { scale: 0.6 })
- `hole()` — Drill a hole into this solid at a face. box(50, 50, 20).hole('top', { diameter: 8, depth: 10 }) box(50, 50, 20).hole('top', { diameter: 6, counterbore: { diameter: 12, depth: 3 } })
- `cutout()` — Cut a profile-shaped pocket through a face using a placed sketch. The sketch must be placed on a face with `Sketch.onFace(...)`. The cut follows the sketch's 2D profile. const profile = circle2d(10).onFace(body, 'top'); body.cutout(profile, { depth: 5 })
