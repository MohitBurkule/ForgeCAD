## Functions

### Curves & Surfacing

Create smooth curves, lofted surfaces, and swept solids.

#### `spline2d()`

```ts
spline2d(points: Vec2[], options?: Spline2DOptions): Sketch
```

Build a smooth Catmull-Rom spline sketch from 2D control points. A closed spline (default) returns a filled profile. An open spline requires a strokeWidth option to produce a solid sketch. Use tension (0..1, default 0.5) to control curve tightness.

<details><summary><code>Spline2DOptions</code></summary>

```ts
interface Spline2DOptions {
  /** Closed loop (default true). */
  closed?: boolean;
  /** Catmull-Rom tension in [0, 1]. 0 = very round, 1 = linear-ish. Default 0.5. */
  tension?: number;
  /** Samples per segment (minimum 3). Default 16. */
  samplesPerSegment?: number;
  /** For open splines, provide stroke width to return a solid Sketch. If omitted for open splines, an error is thrown. */
  strokeWidth?: number;
  /** Stroke join for open splines. Default 'Round'. */
  join?: "Round" | "Square";
}
```

</details>

#### `spline3d()`

```ts
spline3d(points: Vec3$3[], options?: Spline3DOptions): Curve3D
```

Create a reusable 3D spline curve object (Catmull-Rom). The returned Curve3D provides sample(), pointAt(t), tangentAt(t), and length() for downstream use in sweep() or manual path operations.

<details><summary><code>Spline3DOptions</code></summary>

```ts
interface Spline3DOptions {
  /** Closed loop (default false). */
  closed?: boolean;
  /** Catmull-Rom tension in [0, 1]. 0 = very round, 1 = linear-ish. Default 0.5. */
  tension?: number;
}
```

</details>

#### `loft()`

```ts
loft(profiles: Sketch[], heights: number[], options?: LoftOptions): Shape
```

Loft between multiple sketches along Z stations. Profiles can differ in topology and vertex count: interpolation is done on signed-distance fields and meshed with level-set extraction. Heights must be strictly increasing. Compatible loft stacks can export through the OCCT exact route. Performance note: loft is significantly heavier than primitive/extrude/revolve. If the part is axis-symmetric (bottles, vases, knobs), prefer revolve().

<details><summary><code>LoftOptions</code></summary>

```ts
interface LoftOptions {
  /** Marching-grid edge length for level-set meshing. Smaller = finer. */
  edgeLength?: number;
  /** Optional extra bounds padding. */
  boundsPadding?: number;
}
```

</details>

#### `sweep()`

```ts
sweep(profile: Sketch, path: Curve3D | Vec3$3[], options?: SweepOptions): Shape
```

Sweep a 2D profile along a 3D path to create a solid. Path can be a Curve3D from spline3d() or an array of [x,y,z] points (polyline). The profile is interpreted in the local frame normal plane. Compatible sweeps can export through the OCCT exact route using the canonical path representation. Performance note: sweep uses level-set meshing internally. Prefer direct primitives/extrude/revolve when they can express the same shape.

<details><summary><code>SweepOptions</code></summary>

```ts
interface SweepOptions {
  /** Number of samples when path is a Curve3D. Default 48. */
  samples?: number;
  /** Marching-grid edge length for level-set meshing. Smaller = finer. */
  edgeLength?: number;
  /** Optional extra bounds padding. */
  boundsPadding?: number;
  /** Preferred "up" vector for local profile frame. Auto fallback is used near parallel segments. */
  up?: Vec3$3;
}
```

### `HermiteCurve3D`

A cubic Hermite curve in 3D space. Interpolates between two endpoints matching position and tangent (G1 continuity). Weight parameters control tangent magnitude, affecting the "reach" of the curve along each edge's direction before turning.

**Properties:**

|----------|------|-------------|
| `p0` | `Vec3$4` | Start position |
| `p1` | `Vec3$4` | End position |

### `QuinticHermiteCurve3D`

A quintic Hermite curve in 3D space. Interpolates between two endpoints matching position, tangent, and second derivative (G2 / curvature continuity). Uses degree-5 Hermite basis functions. Weight parameters scale tangent magnitudes relative to chord length. Curvature vectors are scaled by weight² * chordLength² for consistent behavior.

**Properties:**

| `c0` | `Vec3$4` | Scaled second derivative at start (curvature * weight² * chordLength²) |
| `c1` | `Vec3$4` | Scaled second derivative at end (curvature * weight² * chordLength²) |
| `chordLength` | `number` | Chord length (straight-line distance between endpoints) |

**Methods:**

- `pointAt()` — Evaluate position at parameter t ∈ [0, 1]
- `tangentAt()` — Evaluate tangent (first derivative, normalized) at parameter t ∈ [0, 1]
- `curvatureAt()` — Evaluate curvature vector (second derivative) at parameter t ∈ [0, 1]
- `sample()` — Sample the curve as a polyline of evenly-spaced parameter values.

### `PathBuilder`

**Methods:**

- `getX()` — Current cursor X position.
- `getY()` — Current cursor Y position.
- `moveTo()` — moveTo(x: number, y: number): this
- `lineTo()` — lineTo(x: number, y: number): this
- `lineH()` — lineH(dx: number): this
- `lineV()` — lineV(dy: number): this
- `lineAngled()` — lineAngled(length: number, degrees: number): this
- `lineBy()` — lineBy(dx: number, dy: number): this
- `arcBy()` — arcBy(dx: number, dy: number, radius: number, clockwise?: boolean): this
- `bezierBy()` — bezierBy(dcp1x: number, dcp1y: number, dcp2x: number, dcp2y: number, dx: number,
- `arcTo()` — Draw a circular arc from the current position to (x, y) with the given radius. `clockwise=true`  → arc curves to the right of the start→end direction. `clockwise=false` → arc curves to the left  of the start→end direction.
- `tangentArcTo()` — G1-continuous arc — radius derived from current tangent + endpoint. Throws if endpoint is collinear with current direction.
- `exactArcTo()` — Exact circular arc to (x, y) using a rational-quadratic / true-arc definition. Unlike a tessellated `arcTo`, this preserves the exact arc center and winding so that exact backends (OCCT) can emit a true cylindrical face. On sampled backends it tessellates the same exact arc geometry adaptively.
- `arc()` — Draw an arc defined by center, radius, and angle range (no trig needed). If the path has no segments yet, automatically moves to the arc start. Positive sweep (startDeg < endDeg) = CCW, negative = CW. ```js // Arc centered at (10, 0), radius 50, from -30° to +30° path().arc(10, 0, 50, -30, 30).stroke(8, 'Round') ```
- `arcAround()` — Arc around a known center point, sweeping by the given angle. Radius is derived from the distance between the current position and the center. Positive sweep = CCW (math convention), negative = CW. ```js // Arc 90° CCW around (50, 50) path().moveTo(70, 50).arcAround(50, 50, 90) // Arc 45° CW around the origin path().moveTo(10, 0).arcAround(0, 0, -45) ```
- `arcAroundRelative()` — Arc around a center point given as an offset from the current position. `(dx, dy)` is the vector from the current point to the center. Positive sweep = CCW (math convention), negative = CW. ```js // Arc 90° CCW around a center 20 units to the right path().moveTo(50, 50).arcAroundRelative(20, 0, 90) // Equivalent to: path().moveTo(50, 50).arcAround(70, 50, 90) ```
- `smoothCapTo()` — Smooth three-arc end cap from the current position to (endX, endY). Inserts: small corner arc → large cap arc → small corner arc, all G1-continuous.
- `bezierTo()` — Cubic bezier from current position to (x, y) via two control points.
- `tangentBezierTo()` — G1-continuous cubic bezier — first control point is auto-derived from the current tangent direction. `weight` controls how far the auto-placed control point extends along the tangent (default: 1/3 of the chord). The second control point `(cp2x, cp2y)` must be provided — it controls the arrival curvature. For a fully automatic smooth curve, see `smoothThrough`.
- `smoothThrough()` — Catmull-Rom spline through a list of waypoints from the current position. The current position is included as the first point. The last waypoint becomes the new cursor position.
- `fillet()` — Round the last corner (the junction between the previous two segments) with a tangent arc of the given radius. Must be called after at least two line/arc segments that form a corner. The fillet trims back both segments and inserts a tangent arc. ```js path().moveTo(0,0).lineTo(10,0).lineTo(10,10).fillet(2).lineTo(0,10).close() ```
- `chamfer()` — Chamfer the last corner with a straight cut of the given distance. ```js path().moveTo(0,0).lineTo(10,0).lineTo(10,10).chamfer(2).lineTo(0,10).close() ```
- `mirror()` — Mirror all existing segments across an axis and append the mirrored copy in reverse order, creating a symmetric path. The axis passes through the current cursor position. 'y' mirrors across the local Y-axis (flips X), or `[nx, ny]` for an arbitrary axis direction. ```js // Build right half, mirror to get full symmetric profile path().moveTo(0,0).lineTo(10,0).lineTo(10,5).mirror('x').close() ```
- `toPolyline()` — Return the open path as a sampled 2D polyline of `[x, y]` points.
- `close()` — Close the path and return a filled Sketch. If the path contains multiple sub-paths (multiple moveTo calls), the first sub-path is the outer contour and subsequent sub-paths are holes (subtracted from the outer contour).
- `closeOffset()` — Close the path and return an offset version of the filled Sketch. Positive delta expands outward, negative shrinks inward.
- `stroke()` — stroke(width: number, join?: "Round" | "Square"): Sketch
